      <p><strong>The Outer, Inner, and Secret Refuge Practice of the Mahasiddha Thangtong Gyalpo</strong> <a href="http://www.mangalashribhuti.org/member/documents/ThangtongGyalpoRefuge.pdf"><span class="style1"><br>
Download</span></a> the specific refuge prayer that Rinpoche suggested that we recite to support those in need entitled The Outer,Inner, and Secret Refuge Practice of the Mahasiddha Thangtong Gyalpo. The following is an excerpt from a talk given by Rinpoche on the significance of this prayer:</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;<img src="images/LooksLikeMe_000.jpg" width="227" height="270"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 0;">
        <p style="margin-top: 0;">When you take refuge in the three jewels with devotion on behalf of someone who's died, the three jewels are immediately going to be there and see the whole situation clearly, since you're making that connection. Where can the deceased escape from the broad view of the three jewels? Their compassion, blessings, and guidance will be immediately there. Even though the dead don't know how to make that connection, if you make it on their behalf, they immediately make the connection as well. Therefore I think doing the practice of refuge, reciting the refuge over and over for the deceased, is very powerful, especially during the first forty-nine days. The prayer we should do is Avalokiteshvara's refuge prayer, called The Outer,Inner, and Secret Refuge Practice of the Mahasiddha Thangtong Gyalpo.&nbsp; This prayer is very helpful. I do it all the time, day and night, whenever there's a need. It was given directly to Thangtong Gyalpo's teacher by Avalokiteshvara himself for Thangtong Gyalpo to spread, and later he received it from his teacher and spread it. It has been one of the most powerful refuge prayers of all. I've given it to a few people to do it, to transform their life circumstances and different difficulties and patterns, and it seems like it really has worked wonderfully. </p>

the most incomprehensible tragedy of insanity. There is no way to even 
begin to understand what has happened. We can only sit with the 
overwhelming sadness and loss of the innocent. The guardian of humanity 
could not have to face anything more grave than losing the young 
unopened buds that were on their way to bloom. We pray that some relief 
may come in this time of loss and to the broken hearts of the parents, 
family members, and our countrymen and women. This kind of tragedy is 
happening way too often in our country, where only a few miles away in 
Canada, it is a rare occurrence. I join my palms in prayer for America

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Dear Rinpoche and MSB sangha,<br>
  My nephew's little baby Richard is back in the hospital.  This morning his mother noticed head enlargement and baby R was readmitted with fluids in the brain.  The shunt in his head has failed so the little guy is going in to replace the shunt.  The replacement is not entirely unexpected, but not so soon.  I have attached a photo of babies Richard and Wren at home before this situation arose.  The parents are deeply concerned for the child's future, and my brother and sister-in-law are exhausted by the ups and downs. Jim and I are on the way to CA to support these dear people.  If you would please include these little ones in your prayers, we would all be most grateful.  Thank you.<br>

  I am amazed at the power of our protectors and Rinpoche's protection.I am euphorically optimistic. The doc has reversed the chemo order, and says it's amazing how small the initial examining doctor caught this tumor. They will be checking me again later. I feel that I can now work on this from a place of strength. Thank you so much, you have all been very kind. If you want to keep up on my situation and healing as i continue to go through the maze, send me an email and I'll put you on the list. Also any references on colon cancer and health are gratefully invited.<br>
  May we always be able to benefit beings through our practice and study and prayers.<br>
  Love and gratitude,<br>

  I have been diagnosed with colo-rectal cancer, not staged yet and see the doctor tomorrow for more specifics beyond &quot;you will be doing chemo and radiation.&quot; I may be coming back to Boulder, stay tuned on that.<br>
  I feel very strongly that the best way that sangha in general can suppport me is to say prayers. Also if you would, please also pray for my Daughter Mikhaela and all of my family to be strong and maintain good state of mind  I am praying for my mind to be clear, and with the inevitable fogginess of chemo and radiation that I will have support to practice and study and keep bringing me back to the nature.<br>
  In terms of practical support, I want to start a blog, and people will be able to reference that for more information. You are all warmly invited to email me at errism@hotmail.com. The survival rate for this seems to be very good-high percentages.<br>
  <br>
  Already I have such good moral suppport from  good friends such as Daniel Hess, who has immediately begun cheering me on.<br>
  <br>
  I love you all, and I want you to know that I am feeling well and very fortunate to have such a treatable cancer.<br>

      <p style="margin-top: 0;">Dear Sangha,<br>
      Thank you for your prayers for Ma Jaya Sati Bhagavati, a teacher who has benefitted many.  She passed on&nbsp; April 13 from pancreatic cancer.  She will leave behind Kashi ashram which is suffering from uncertainty and great grief.  This was my family for 25 years, and there is great good heartedness and bodhichitta there.  Please hold them all in your prayers.  Thank you,  Ram Jyoti </p>

      <p style="margin-top: 0;">I would like to request prayers for my Father Sal DeGuarda who passed away March 4, in Walnut Creek, CA. He suffered much mental anguish towards letting go of his body and this life.He had energy and zest for life that amazed people half his age. He also had a project, a statue on Treasure Island,that he said over and over  he would not die until he completed.Seeing this larger than life man having to let go was very difficult. I am so thankful to have Dharma practice and a wonderful SPR Therese, who helped me to help him through this. He was 93 and did exit peacefully. <br>
        And who knows maybe one day we will drive over  the Bay Bridge and there will be his statue, Pacifica waving at us.<br>
      Thank you,  Daralyn</p>

      <p style="margin-top: 0;">Dear Sangha,<br>
        On Sunday night 3/11 at 3 am 5 young people were involved in a car accident in the Baca.  Travis Tim was killed. Colin Drew is in intensive care in Denver and very badly injured.  The others are Zack Lamaster, the driver, and Maxie and Rheena whose last names I don't know at this time, nor their conditions.  Please hold them in your hearts and your practice.  This is a dreadful tragedy for the Crestone community and blaming will no doubt occur.  May all those lives are touched by this find the help they need and heal in every way.  The prayers of the sangha are so powerful.<br>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Michal Lura Friedman lost her life on Friday, November 25, 2011 in New York City, due to complications from a c-section shortly after delivering healthy twins, Jackson James and Reverie Vivian Snyder.  Michal was a beautiful, talented woman who was thrilled to be pregnant with her first children. Many of you know &quot;Michal the Girl&quot; as a musician, but her greatest dream was to be a mother. For seven long years she and Jay tried to make this dream come true. Michal was widely loved, and leaves behind loving family and many friends in her Buddhist and music and voice communities. Please pray for Michal and her family. </p>
