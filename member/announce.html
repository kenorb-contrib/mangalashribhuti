<p style="margin-top: 0;"><strong>SHABTEN PRAYERS: A CORRECTED BREAKDOWN OF CONTRIBUTIONS</strong><br>
Dear Noble Sangha and Friends,<br>
As you have read in the recent shabten announcement, we have begun our 
Sangha-wide yearly prayers for the well-being and auspicious activity of
 our teacher, the Venerable Dzigar Kongtrul Rinpoche, and the MSB 
Sangha.<br>
 <br>
This year there are many prayers and pujas to complete. We have humbly 
requested several monasteries and nunneries in India to help us 
accomplish this. It is traditional to make offerings when making such 
requests. We have taken this opportunity to let you know about this so 
you may also support and contribute to these offering endeavors.<br>
 <br>
We also must make a correction from our last email. Though we did make 
an offering to His Eminence Tai Situ Rinpoche for conducting this year's
 mo (divination), and as a Sangha intend to gratefully continue to do so
 in the years to come, the amount offered to His Eminence was <strong>$200</strong>, not $2,600.<br>
 <br>
The <strong>total amount</strong> we have offered for the divination, the prayers, and the pujas is <strong>$2600</strong>. For a detailed breakdown, please see the list below. We apologize for this error.<br>
 <br>
Thank you for your kind understanding, and please join us in making 
offerings to the lamas, monks, and nuns who are helping us complete the 
extensive pujas and prayers for this year's shabten for Dzigar Kongtrul 
Rinpoche and the Mangala Shri Bhuti Sangha.<br>
 <br>
Yours in the Dharma,<br>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Letter From Rinpoche Regarding Norway</strong></p>
<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><span style="font-family:Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:13px;">Dear Sangha and Friends,</span></p>
<p class="style9" style="margin-top:0;">I was deeply shocked and saddened by the recent events in  Norway. In particular, what struck me was that if one becomes an extremist in one&rsquo;s  ideology this can lead to actions that cause such great  harm to others, even one&rsquo;s fellow citizens, who are innocent of any wrongdoing.  I can only imagine the karma of such an act.</p>
<p class="style9">I ask that we all make prayers continuously, not only for  those who have lost lives, but especially for the families, so that their loss  and grief might be eased. May the emotional and mental anguish that these acts  have caused the country and the world also be eased. </p>
<p class="style9">I am greatly heartened and inspired by how the people of Norway  have faced this crisis and hope their response can serve as an example of  non-violence for us all. Let us also pray that extremist views of any kind not  take hold in people&rsquo;s minds but be softened with tolerance and kindness towards  all mankind. </p>
<p class="style9" style="margin-bottom: 0;">Yours in the Dharma, </p>
<p class="style9" style="margin-top:0;">Kongtrul Rinpoche</p>
<p><strong>10/17/10<br>
        Letter to Sangha Regarding Participating in Monthly Tsoks<br>
      </strong>Dear Sangha,</p>
      <p>Following the most recent Dakini Dechen Gyalmo Drupcho it may be helpful to remind sangha members and friends about the policy Rinpoche has set regarding attending the monthly dakini and guru tsoks. Rinpoche has spoken repeatedly about the wonderful opportunity for purification and progress on the path by amending samaya during the regular tsok practice. He has also set a policy regarding who would attend these tsoks. All students who have gone through the MSB Sangha Ceremony are invited to attend tsoks and make torma on a regular basis with or without the corresponding empowerments. </p>
      <p>For people who have not gone through the MSB Sangha Ceremony, one must have received the corresponding empowerment (Rigdzin Dupa and Dechen Gyalmo) from an authentic lineage holder. In addition, Rinpoche requires people to write a letter of request at least 24 hours prior to the tsok to <a href="mailto:dharmarakcha@mangalashribhuti.org"><br>
     dharmarakcha@mangalashribhuti.org</a> and be approved in order to attend.</p>
      <p>Thank you,</p>
      <p>Khenchung and Dharmarakcha<br>

        Karuna Maitri Support Group: A Letter from VDKR </strong><br>
Dear Noble Sangha,</p>
      <p>I would like to start a Sangha based support group called the Karuna Maitri<br>
      Support Group.</p>
      <p>My vision is that this group of people could serve as a support to those in<br>
        need, who are having a hard time in their lives, suffering from loss or<br>
      depression, and to be there during the death and dying process.</p>
      <p>It would be wonderful if there could be a small group of people who are<br>
        inspired to serve in such a way in each location where we are gathered:<br>
      Boulder, Crestone, and Vermont, for starters.</p>
      <p>This should be self inspired and all you need is compassion for others. we<br>
        could have a point person in each location and then people could work<br>
      together loosely as needed.</p>
      <p>I will provide some simple instructions, as we see who is interested in<br>
      joining in.</p>
      <p>If you are interested or inspired to be a part of this or know more, contact<br>
        Jennifer during the shedra. If you are out of town please send a note to my<br>
        secretary Rebecca Zepp and she will let me know.<a href="mailto:vdkrsecretary@mangalashribhuti.org"><br>
      vdkrsecretary@mangalashribhuti.org</a></p>
      <p>Thank you</p>

        New Ngondro Set <br>
      </strong><em>&ldquo;Refuge lays the ground, and Bodhicitta is the main path. In that main path there is a need of purifying one&rsquo;s obscurations and accumulating merit for one&rsquo;s own innate enlightened nature to shine and reveal itself from the veil of obscuration.&rdquo;</em></p>
      <p>Wisdom Productions is pleased to announce the release of the third disk in the Words Of My Perfect Teacher Ngondro series. This set is titled &ldquo;Purification and Accumulation -- Practices of Vajrasattva and Mandala&rdquo; and includes detailed explanations regarding each of these practices.<br>
        <br>
        <u>Vajrasattva</u><br>
        Rinpoche paraphrases Patrul Rinpoche in the following two quotations:<br>
      &ldquo;The reason we don&rsquo;t make so much progress is because we do not put enough effort to purify what holds us back.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;One of the reasons why we don&rsquo;t make progress as much as we could is because we are not so open to confess our own obscurations.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Being able to confess fully and sincerely is a pivotal step in being able to relax with one&rsquo;s mind. In these talks Kongtrul Rinpoche gives advice on how to get over guilt and other unhelpful emotional reactions to our past deeds and present mind states. If we can learn the proper way to view and approach the practices of confession and purification, we will see these practices working in our mind on a day to day basis. We will grow more relaxed and confident in our mind and our intentions, and we will be able to overcome certain mind states that keep us from engaging deeply in practice.</p>
      <p>The Vajrasattva section also includes commentary on visualization practice, which practitioners of both Ngondro and Sadhana will find helpful.</p>
      <p><u>Mandala<br>
      </u>Mandala practice is a means of training the mind to open up further in our relationship to the phenomenal world. It leads us to realize that we can use so many experiences in our daily lives to further expand our hearts and minds through making mental offerings. We do this practice to accumulate merit in order to further purify our minds and to bring about the appropriate circumstances for realization. We make offerings on the level of each of the three kayas, which helps to further expand our understanding of the mind and it&rsquo;s capabilities. These talks include a detailed section on merit, and also much discussion of the three kayas in relation to the mandala offering.</p>
      <p>We welcome you to take advantage of this valuable compilation of teachings!</p>

  Retreats at Pema Osel<br>
</strong>Dear Noble Sangha,</p>
<p>As winter closes in and the last signs of autumn slip away, retreat seems very natural -- it is time to go inside literally and figuratively. We have been so lucky to have many people coming into retreat at Pema Osel. The fall has been booked and many people will be doing retreats throughout the winter. Thank you for taking the opportunity!</p>
      <p>Our lovely and spacious cabin is available all of December as well as the end of February and March. Take some time and come up and do retreat. Remember even a few days away can make a big difference in our minds. We look forward to supporting your retreat.</p>
      <p>Sincerely,</p>
      <p>Pema Osel retreat staff<br>

    Riwo Sangcho Eligibility<br>
      </strong>Dear Sangha,</p>
      <p>Rinpoche recently said that anyone who has attended one of the Riwo Sangcho retreats in Vermont can do the practice on their own. A separate lung is not required. <br>
  To order a liturgy, go to: <a href="http://www.mangalashribhuti.org/html/study_practice/liturgies.html">http://www.mangalashribhuti.org/html/study_practice/liturgies.html</a>. Many Tibetan import stores carry Riwo Sangcho incense, which is necessary for doing the practice. Practitioners are also encouraged to study Rinpoche's teachings on this subject. Two different recordings--&quot;Lenchak&quot; and &quot;2006 Riwo Sangcho Retreat&quot;--can be ordered from the MSB store at <a href="http://www.mangalashribhuti.org/html/store/recordings_new.html">http://www.mangalashribhuti.org/html/store/recordings_new.html</a>.</p>

  The Link <br>
      </strong>Dear Noble Sangha, </p>
<p>MSB Sangha members are highly encouraged to listen to the Link teachings each Sunday at their local center rather than listening to the teachings at home. Of course, if you don't live close to a center or are genuinely unable to make it to your local center you are welcome to individually call in.</p>
      <p>Below is the Sunday Sitting at Phuntsok Choling in Ward according to Mountain Time. For those living close to another MSB or MDC Center, please contact those centers for their schedules.</p>
      <p>Phuntsok Choling Sunday Sitting:<br>
  9:00 - 10:00 Opening Prayers and Sitting<br>
  10:00 - ? (Links will be approximately 45 - 60 min. long)<br>
  Closing Prayers will follow the Link</p>
      <p><strong>4/16/09<br>
  Protector Prayers</strong> <strong>CD</strong> <br>
  We will now be doing the Extended Protector Prayers along with an audio CD during group tsoks. Individuals are also permitted to use an audio CD as well. This change came directly from Rinpoche. He wanted the centers to start doing the protector prayers during tsoks along with the recording so people could get into a better habit with pronunciation, tempo, etc. Recordings cost $5 please contact <a href="mailto:events@mangalashribhuti.org" class="style3">Susan Martich</a> to order a CD.<br>
