      <p>DRUPCHO CHILDCARE INFORMATION</p>
      <p>Parents provide childcare for drupchos. 2-3 parents will be scheduled for each day, depending on enrollment. Clare Ming will be the contact person for this event. <br>
  Maximum Ratio of Adult to Child: 3:1<br>
  Parent Help Needed: Meals Coordinator*, Yurt Clean Up, Activities Preparation<br>

  Siddhi's Parent Rotation</p>
      <p>Of course during the drupcho, everyone wants to be in the shrine room during the practice session before and after the siddhis. In order to make this situation fair, we have decided that the best way to choose who will be with the children during the siddhi morning is to go by alphabetical order. That way, no one ends up doing it more than once every few years. </p>
      <p>Drupcho Childcare FAQ</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Q: What if I am only able to attend the drupcho for one day? Can't I practice?</p>
      <p>A: We hope that when this situation occurs, that another parent who might be participating in the whole drupcho might be willing to take another day of childcare. However, all parents are expected to participate fully in the childcare for this event, even if it is just one or two shifts.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Q: What if I have two children in childcare? Will I have to do more shifts? </p>
      <p> A: Yes, most likely, unless there are enough parents and/or volunteers to make it possible for each family to take one shift only.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> Q: What if I am busy with other sangha activities? Do i still need to participate?</p>
      <p> A: Yes. We really want the children to benefit from all of the different parents in our sangha.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> Q: What should I do if I feel overwhelmed?</p>
      <p> A: Talk to the coordinator for the childcare coordinator for that drupcho. We will help you figure things out!</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> Q: What if there are only a few children? Will I have to do multiple days of childcare.</p>
      <p> A: Sometimes it happens that there are just a few children present during the week and the parents of those children end up doing a lot more childcare. Our best suggestion: enjoy yourself and the children and make the most of it! Do some dharma study with the children, go sledding, and be sure to dedicate the merit!!</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> Q: What should I bring?</p>
      <p> A: Please bring full snow gear, a dry change of clothes, sleds, homework. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> Q: What about meals?</p>
      <p> A: Dinner and snacks will be provided during drupchos. Please bring a hearty lunch for your child.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Q: Is childcare provided on the breaks? </p>
      <p> A: Childcare is provided during the four practice sessions and 2 tea breaks. Childcare is not provided during lunch or in the evening after the last session ends. If you will not be able to be with your child at lunch or immediately following the closing chants, you must arrange for another adult to be responsible for your child.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Q: But my child can just take care of him/herself...s/he does it at home all the time. </p>
      <p> A: Due to safety and liability issues, the MSB administration has created a policy that all children must be supervised at all times by an adult while at Phuntsok Choling.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Q: But the older kids can watch the younger ones&hellip;</p>
      <p>A: See above</p>
