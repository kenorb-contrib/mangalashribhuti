<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>5/7/12</strong></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Sangha Fiber Guild Meeting</strong></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0;">This is an invitation to women and men of all Buddhist sanghas in the Boulder area, who have an interest in handwork (knitting; crocheting; spinning wool; embroidery, etc.) to come together as a group and get to know each other.  Sanghas can have a tendency to become insular and not look outside of its own dharma world.  This is an opportunity to come together in a social manner and meet each other and to discuss our common goals; teachings; as well as our common interest in handwork.   This is a way to open up dialogue; respect and mutual interest in what is happening in the larger sangha context, and promotes harmonious inter-sangha relationships. </p>
<p>This will be our 2nd meeting and is open to all with an interest in this craft area.  Please bring your own handwork project to work on and perhaps some “nosh” to share if you are so inspired.  I also hope we can discuss a possible future fundraising project that will benefit a chosen group in Boulder ( such as “premie” unit in hospital, homeless shelter, etc). </p>
<p>We all have the strength of creating social cohesiveness in all aspects of family; society; and our world.  This is just another way of creating  inter-sangha harmony, so please join in the fun! </p>
<p>Our 2nd meeting will be on Sunday,June 3rd at 3pm - 5pm at Nalandabodhi (Dzogchen, Ponlop Rinpoche’s sangha) in Boulder (aka: Odantapuri)  located at 100 Arapahoe, suite #6.  We can discuss our vision for this group at this meeting.   If you have questions you can email me at <a href="mailto:jampa@comcast.net">jampa@comcast.net</a>.<br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Yours in the harmonious sangha!!<br>
